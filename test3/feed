<p>Well folks its time for IMPRINT to depart the digital stage and what better way to send ourselves out than a visit from all four of the imprint podcasters.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been emotional.</p>

<p>So &#8211; the Penultimate instalment of our little IMPRINT journey &#8211; #66!</p>
<p>Call it a guilty indulgence if you want but we just had to get our favourite selector <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jamie-nelson-1" target="_blank">Mr Jamie Nelson</a> back behind the decks for another mixtape. This is more of a classic offering though as we&#8217;ve asked him to give us a side A and a side B.</p>
<p>Both are very different animals&#8230;</p>

<p>Ok, so we probably have 2-3 episodes left here an IMPRINT so lets try and squeeze the last bits of life out of this&#8230; This episode is one that I am very excited to bring forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PRMC84" target="_blank">Paul McCarthy</a>, who as you will all know as one of the team here at IMPRINT, has kicked off a great new blog entitled <a href="http://imperialrupes.com/" target="_blank">Imperial Rupes</a>. What he is attempting to do here is to examine the record racks of Belfast’s local charity shops and quite simply, blog about them. He examines not only the good, but the bad and the ugly as well.</p>
<p>IMPRINT 65 is a mix of some the best finds he has come across so far.</p>

<p>For IMPRINT number 64, we pass the reins to a somewhat veteran of Belfast and Bangor&#8217;s DJ scene, Bad Operator. While his CRILLI parties have been sporadic, each has been a proper event and the tunes completely eclectic but ultimately centered around Drum &#8216;n&#8217; Bass driven rhythms.</p>
<p>We asked the man himself to offer us a taste of what a CRILLI party sounds like to him and we have certainly got a taste of that here. This is a heady, banging mix of tunes, designed for the floor and piped directly into your ears via the IMPRINT conduit.</p>

<p>Guess who&#8217;s back&#8230;? Si is back. Podcast #63 sees him go on an exclusively electronic exploration of everything from West Coast beat music and future soul, to dystopian jungle and rhythmic grime.</p>
<p>It’s as frenetic and schizophrenic as you’ve no doubt come to know (and hope) IMPRINT to be…</p>

<p>Tw!tch are one of the best promoters we have in this small city and it felt appropriate to have them contribute to at least something here at IMPRINT.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been to a Tw!tch party, you&#8217;ll know how lairy it can get; hot, sweaty and energetic! So we thought it would be fun to ask the guys to compile a &#8216;Back to Mine&#8217; style mix, to be administered after a Tw!tch bash, to soothe the mind and body.</p>
<p>This mix is a testament to that very vibe and its pure IMPRINT from start to finish &#8211; we love it. Go get sweaty and then stick this on&#8230;</p>

<p>I started IMPRINT in July 2009 after leaving Queen&#8217;s and ending a 3 year stint on Student Radio. Initially it was just me going alone but after a few years, Si McNair, Paul McCarthy and Emma Smith joined the ranksand started putting out podcasts as well.</p>
<p>Now, in the first half of 2014, we&#8217;ve decided to put IMPRINT to bed so we can move on to do other things.</p>
<p>Sometime in the next three months, we&#8217;ll have our final episode but until then, it&#8217;s business as usual and after this episode we are going to a few guests popping by and a few special edition episodes.</p>
<p>Anyway, enjoy episode 60, it&#8217;s IMPRINT, exactly as you know it.</p>

<p>Its that time of year again where we get around a table and wax lyrical about some of our favourite sounds of 2013 &#8211; if you remember correct we did <a href="http://www.imprintthisonyourmind.co.uk/podcast-52-2013-so-far" target="_blank">this</a> back in June as well, where we looked at the year so far. We have tried not to repeat ourselves too much but to be honest, some stuff was so good it had to go on twice!</p>
<p>Grab it from the link above and hit us up on <a href="https://twitter.com/_imprint_" target="_blank">twitter</a> if you feel like we got it really right, or really wrong!</p>
